To run the project on a machine , docker and docker-compose should be installed and running on the machine.  To run the project, just run following command 

docker-compose up 

NOTE: All the files and folders names and relative location shouldnâ€™t be changed.  To run the project , navigate to the ubuntu folder given and run docker-compose up. 
The rest of the files were used for testing and they are not required in the project. 





The source folder is mounted on container A.
The destination folder is mounted to Container B. 
The shared folder is mounted to both the Containers. Consider shared folder as a network shared drive which is accessible from both the Containers. 

Flow chart can be seen in files.
